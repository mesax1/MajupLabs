## Power Up Your Google Workspace

If your team lives in Gmail, Sheets, and Drive, there's a world of automation waiting for you. Learn to eliminate the repetitive tasks that consume hours of your day.

## Why Automate Google Workspace?

### Sheets as a Database

Transform your spreadsheets into complete management systems. Self-updating dashboards, alerts when something changes, and reports that send themselves automatically.
