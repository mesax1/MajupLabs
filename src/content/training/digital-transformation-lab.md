## Experiment, Build, Transform

The Digital Transformation Lab is an experiential program designed for teams that want to go beyond theory. Here you don't just learn about AI—you apply it directly to your company's real challenges.

## What is the Lab?

It's a practical experimentation space where your team:

- **Identifies** automation and AI opportunities in their processes
- **Builds** functional solutions during sessions
- **Validates** impact with real metrics from your business
- **Implements** the most effective solutions in production

Unlike traditional courses, each lab session produces **actionable deliverables** your team can use immediately.

## Program Structure

### Phase 1: Diagnosis and Quick Wins

We start by mapping your current processes and identifying where AI can generate immediate value. During this phase:

- We analyze existing workflows
- We identify repetitive, high-volume tasks
- We prioritize opportunities by impact and feasibility
- We define the first pilot projects

### Phase 2: Practical Labs

Each lab focuses on building a specific solution:

**Automation Lab**
Learn to connect your tools and eliminate manual tasks. We work with platforms like N8N, Google Apps Script, Power Automate, and more.

**Intelligent Agents Lab**
Build chatbots and agents that answer questions, process requests, and execute tasks semi-autonomously.

**Data and Insights Lab**
Transform scattered data into actionable information with dashboards, automatic reports, and AI-powered analysis.

### Phase 3: Implementation and Scaling

We don't leave solutions as prototypes. We accompany you in:

- Production deployment
- Documentation and knowledge transfer
- Maintenance and evolution plan
- Identification of next projects

## Systems You'll Build

| System | Benefit |
|--------|---------|
| **Custom automations** | Eliminate friction and scale effortlessly |
| **Intelligent chatbots** | Multiply your 24/7 service capacity |
| **Semi-autonomous agents** | Delegate repetitive tasks to AI |
| **Lead pipelines** | Improve quality and reduce manual work |
| **Automatic reports** | Real-time data-driven decisions |

## Lab Tools

Throughout the program you'll experiment with:

- **N8N**: Workflow automation
- **AI APIs**: OpenAI, Anthropic, Google AI
- **Google Workspace**: Apps Script, Sheets, Gmail
- **Microsoft 365**: Power Automate, Copilot, SharePoint
- **Scraping tools**: Intelligent web data extraction
- **Vector databases**: For semantic search

## Who is the Lab For?

This program is designed for **complete teams**, not individuals. The idea is that knowledge stays within the organization and projects have clear owners.

It works especially well for:

- Teams already using digital tools but wanting to optimize
- Organizations undergoing digital transformation
- Companies wanting to reduce dependency on external developers
- Areas with many manual and repetitive tasks

## Working Methodology

Each lab session follows this structure:

1. **Context** (15 min): Key concepts and success stories
2. **Demonstration** (20 min): Facilitator builds live
3. **Guided Practice** (60 min): Your team builds with support
4. **Application** (25 min): Adaptation to your specific case
5. **Closure** (10 min): Next steps and assignments

## Program Deliverables

Upon completion, your team will have:

- Minimum 3 automations running in production
- A chatbot or AI agent configured for your business
- Documentation of automated processes
- Roadmap for next AI projects
- Trained team to maintain and extend solutions
