## What is an Innovation Bootcamp with AI?

It's a practical, customized program for your company where your teams work on **real challenges** applying generative artificial intelligence, agile methodologies, and strategic thinking. This isn't traditional training—it's a collaborative experience focused on delivering **tangible results from day one**.

Each bootcamp is designed to measure, according to your objectives, your team, and your priorities.

## Our Methodology

Our bootcamps follow an agile, adaptable, results-focused structure:

### 1. Diagnosis and Opportunity Identification

We start with a context analysis to detect strategic challenges where generative AI can create real value for your organization. We use advanced technology monitoring techniques to identify trends and opportunities through analytical tools.

### 2. Building Solutions with AI

Through practical dynamics, your team builds functional prototypes in real-time using generative AI tools and techniques. We work with real cases from your company to maximize applicability.

### 3. Validation, Adjustment, and Strategic Closure

We validate the results obtained, optimize, and leave a clear plan of next steps for implementation. All this in agile sessions, guided by expert facilitators, adapted to your company's pace and reality.

## What We Deliver

Each bootcamp delivers concrete results:

- **A functional prototype** focused on a key company challenge
- **A validation report** and clear action plan
- **A trained team** to replicate the innovation process with AI in new initiatives
- **Additional resources** and optional post-bootcamp support

## Topics We Cover

Each bootcamp is customized, but we address key themes to transform how your company innovates:

- Real application of generative AI in strategic processes
- Task automation and optimization with AI
- User-centered experience design (UX)
