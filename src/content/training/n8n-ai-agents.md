## Automate Your Business with N8N and AI

N8N is one of the most powerful and flexible automation tools on the market. Combined with artificial intelligence, it allows you to create systems that work for you 24/7.

## Why N8N?

Unlike other tools like Zapier or Make, N8N offers you:

- **No execution limits**: Run your automations without worrying about per-execution costs
- **Self-hosted or cloud**: Control your data or use the cloud, you decide
- **Code when you need it**: Access to JavaScript and Python for complex cases
- **Active community**: Thousands of templates and nodes created by the community

## What You'll Learn

### Workflow Automation

From basic to advanced. You'll learn to connect your favorite tools and eliminate manual tasks that consume your time.

### API Integration

Connect any service that has an API. You don't need to be a programmer: you'll learn to read API documentation and translate it to N8N nodes.

### AI Agents

The real magic: combine N8N with language models like GPT-4 or Claude to create agents that reason, make decisions, and execute actions.

### Intelligent Web Scraping

Extract information from websites automatically. With AI, you can process and structure that information for your needs.

## Systems You'll Build

| System | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Lead Enrichment Pipeline** | Get lead data from LinkedIn, enrich with AI, and load to your CRM |
| **Sales Chatbot** | Bot for WhatsApp or Telegram that answers questions and qualifies leads |
| **Content Repurposer** | Transform an article into social media posts with AI |
| **Email Assistant** | Classify, summarize, and respond to emails automatically |
| **Data Sync Hub** | Keep all your systems synchronized in real-time |

## Methodology

Each session combines theory and practice. You build while you learn:

1. **Concept** (15 min): Topic explanation
2. **Live Demo** (20 min): Instructor builds step by step
3. **Guided Practice** (45 min): You build with support
4. **Challenge** (10 min): Apply what you learned to your own case

## Prerequisites

- Computer with internet access
- No programming experience required
- Willingness to automate
